### CPSC 120L

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because we were able to "order" a sandwich to our liking.
    When we were given the task to code this I was curious as to how the code would function in order to print out
    the kind of bread you'd like as well as the meat, and topping like mustard or ketchup. We coded an if statement that contained a vector of strings, of it stating that if it had less than 4 arguments then it wouldn't print out your order.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a tricky one yet one of the labs that I'm proud of. We were able to make a function that calculates the difference between the dates being given to the code, to run on. We used the code of Julian Day to calculate the difference between given dates.


* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 is also one of the labs that I am proud of because I was able to finish that during class time with my partner. We used bool, int main, int num, int var, while if, etc so it can "Find Prime Numbers." It was kinda hard for me to complete this lab on my own but like they say 2 brains is better than 1.
